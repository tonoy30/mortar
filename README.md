# The Mortar Programming Language

## Expressed as a list of features, Mortar has the following:

```
It supports:
  * mathematical expressions, 
  * variable bindings, 
  * functions and the application of those functions,
  * conditionals,
  * return statements and even advanced concepts like

    * integers,
    * booleans,
    * strings,
    * arrays and 
    * dict
```
